	<h2>ELO 08: Day 2</h2>
	<p class="note">Jun 21 2008, 6:14AM</p>
	<p>Ok, it's been about 3 weeks since the conference, but I'm just now getting the time to review my notes and post...</p>

<h3>Transliteracy</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.suethomas.net">Sue Thomas</a> started with a discussion on transliteracy.  Defined simply as "the ability to read, write, and interact across a range of platforms, tools and media," transliteracy insists on a lateral approach according to Thomas : "global, historical, holistic." As several others discussed later as well, Thomas made the point that reading/writing in the traditional sense isn't a privileged means of communication anymore. </p>

<p>On the topic of the convergence of media/communications technology she quoted <a href="http://www.henryjenkins.org/">Henry Jenkins</a> as saying there are at least 5 processes that are a part of convergence: technological, economic, social/organic, cultural, and global. The article <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Biztech/12434/">Convergence? I Diverge</a> by Jenkins explains more...</p>

<p>Another interesting thread that was picked up in other discussions was a reference to Katherine Hayles' <a href="http://www.mlajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1632/prof.2007.2007.1.187?journalCode=prof">Hyper and Deep Attention</a> and the point that hyper-attention probably developed first, where as the deep-attention our culture/educational system emphasizes for literacy now is a kind of luxury that developed later.</p>

<p>In discussion from the audience the question was raised: why use the term 'literacy'? It's connected to the book tradition that we're de-emphasizing.</p>

<h3>Log in</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.as.wvu.edu/~sbaldwin/">Sandy Baldwin</a>'s presentation felt more like spoken word poetry then an academic paper - it was great, but flew by a little quickly. He talked about the paths that a packet takes across the network to it's destination, what a tool like traceroute tells us about that 'landscape' and how logging on is 'inscribing' yourself into that landscape.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alansondheim.org/">Alan Sondheim</a> presented remotely. He first showed a video, something similar to the video at the end of <a href="http://nikuko.blogspot.com/2008/03/apologies-for-not-responding-here-ive.html">this blog post</a>. I like that glitch-art aesthetic. He talked about the 'mess' or 'debris' that fills cyberspace (and is the 'essential character of culture'). Logging on and off used to be a simple binary - but now we're always partially logged on, logged out but recognized (say by a cookie in your browser), using multiple logins for a given service, or victims of a confused identity. It's neither a, nor b, but something in between, or something that overlaps. He describes that liminal place as the place where the ego is.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.english.ucsb.edu/people-detail.asp?PersonID=138">Rita Raley</a>'s talk I find difficult to summarize - but I felt that her perspective was closest to my own. She talked about using data, either gathered like Hansen/Rubin's Listening Post or solicited. Seemed to me to be related to social networks, and data visualization.</p>

<h3>ReVisioning Electronic Literature</h3>
<p><a href="http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~mcmarino/">Mark Marino</a> talked about the history of chatbots, AI, and the Turing test. He used an interesting model in his talk based around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_network_theory">actor network theory</a> - humans and machines are both conversational actors within a common network. He also brought in an interesting historical perspective on this kind of network : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_friend_or_foe">military IFF systems</a>. I liked this presentation because it de-emphasized the concern over traditional AI (can we build a real thinking machine?) and presented a bigger context - the network as a whole.</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremydouglass.com/">Jeremy Douglass</a> is a researcher at <a href="http://lab.softwarestudies.com/">Software Studies</a>, a program I've been tracking with much interest. He talked about the mental 'geography' that a user might develop during an interactive process with a given software system. For a non-programmer in particular, there's that negotiation where they develop a model of how the system works, test out their model, and adjust as needed. Douglass calls this model 'implied code.' As he discussed, interesting games/systems allow enough room for the user to explore, and experience that moment (as a surprise) when their implied code and the machine code sync, and new possibilities are discovered.</p>

<h3>Elit as IS</h3>
<p>The final group of presentations was somewhat more technical/pragmatic. <a href="http://www.math.fsu.edu/~jgutierr/jbg_personal/index_en.html">Juan Gutierrez</a> led an interesting discussion about applying the multitier model from software (presentation/logic/data) to electronic literature.</p>
