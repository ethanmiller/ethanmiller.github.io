		<h3><a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/alertsite_pagerduty/">AlertSite to PagerDuty</a></h3>
		<p class="note">May 28 2012, 4:58PM</p>
		<p>
From the "had an itch" desk: A simple tool to translate between to APIs.

For users of both AlertSite and PagerDuty there's no ideal integration alternative. AlertSite will notify with an HTTP POST, and PagerDuty's API will accept POST data, but the formats are incompatible.
This is a ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/alertsite_pagerduty/">_ more</a></p>
	
		<h3><a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/cronline/">Cronline (Cron visualization)</a></h3>
		<p class="note">Aug 10 2011, 9:06AM</p>
		<p>I recently hacked up a project I'm calling 'Cronline' and I'm hoping to get some feedback on further development.
Motivation
We run a large number of crontab scripts on different systems, under different user accounts. We see the mail that results from most jobs, and get reports when ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/cronline/">_ more</a></p>
	
		<h3><a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/test_server_puzzle/">Test Server Puzzle</a></h3>
		<p class="note">Feb 2 2011, 11:14PM</p>
		<p> I recently had the opportunity to rebuild our test server system for QA testing at work, and I found a few solutions that I thought worth sharing. The finished system centers around a custom console for reserving test servers, launching repository checkouts and/or database reloads, and viewing a short ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/test_server_puzzle/">_ more</a></p>

		<p>My collaboration with Ethan Ham, Virtual State of Jefferson will be going up in Ashland at the Schneider Museum of Art next month.

I wanted to describe a little about the tech work involved because I had fun, and it might be useful to others. The piece is a router ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/virtual_state_jefferson_tech/">_ more</a></p>
	
		<h3><a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/jquery_simplemultiselect/">jQuery Simple Multi-Select</a></h3>
		<p class="note">Sep 10 2009, 9:37PM</p>
		<p>    v 1.1.2 Jun 06 2012
    This plugin replaces a standard multi-select with a simplified version that doesn't require ctrl+click to select multiple options. Each click simply toggles the given option on or off. The original multi-select is hidden, and a replacement is built. The original multi-select ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/jquery_simplemultiselect/">_ more</a></p>
	
		<h3><a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/appengine_handle_entity/">Appengine and handle_entity</a></h3>
		<p class="note">Jun 17 2009, 12:52AM</p>
		<p>Just spent a frustrating evening with Google AppEngine - and I want to document the problem I had in case it helps others.

I wanted to upload data to AppEngine from a CSV file - however the values in said file needed some adjustments (they don't directly correspond to the fields ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/appengine_handle_entity/">_ more</a></p>

		<p class="note">May 19 2009, 9:01PM</p>
		<p>Ubiquity seems like a great project. However, in my case, I've tried it twice and just haven't managed to fold it into my workflow. I'm not entirely sure why that is - but part of it has to do with my aversion to using the mouse more than ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/ubiquity_click/">_ more</a></p>

		<p>Here's a question that keep coming up lately: In the context of data flows, what should I treat like a stream, and what should I treat like a reservoir?
To explain what I mean by example: my email inbox is a reservoir. Although data streams in, it's clearly ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/stream_or_reservoir/">_ more</a></p>

		<p>This lifehacker post about a DiskDigger reminded me that I wanted to document a recent close call with a bunch of photos we took on vacation.

I was running Ubuntu with xfce, and when the SD card on our camera filled up, I wanted to transfer the photos off.  Well ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/lost_images/">_ more</a></p>

		<p>We got a Neuros Link last week. It's basically an Ubuntu box with HDMI out and a handy wireless keyboard. I want to say a few things about how it has changed the space in front of the TV, and then I have some comments about the Neuros Link ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/technology_shapes_space/">_ more</a></p>

		<p>Reading Digital Media

Laura Borr√†s Castanyer and Joan Elies Adell both from Hermeneia discussed how the operation of reading works in the light of new and changing technologies. As in other presentations they brought up the contrast between 'surface' reading, or 'sufing' the text instead of immersion in a text ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/elo08_day3/">_ more</a></p>

		<p>Mark Amerika presented the opening workshop "Remix Writing and Postproduction Art" this morning. He began with this Vito Acconci quote about interdisciplinary practices. Later in the morning this led into an interesting question about using the term 'literature' for practices that are mostly audio/visual.

		<p>I've been excited about using Pyglet for  all it's nice timing/windowing/event handling. And then I got excited about the nice graphics programming from PyCairo.I couldn't find any examples of the two combined, so, with the help of this PyGame example I munged the following ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/pyglet_pycairo/">_ more</a></p>

		<p class="note">Aug 12 2007, 4:53PM</p>
		<p>I spent my entire undergrad and several years after that pretty seriously dedicated to canvas painting. There had always been a kind of formalism I was interested in that had to do with systematic arrangements and relationships. In early work this took the form as simplified narrative images with figures ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/old_paintings/">_ more</a></p>

		<p>Thomas got us all together to build a quickly robot. I'm pretty happy with mine, at least I didn't solder-destroy anything. It needs some tuning though, but on one side at least it definitely follows light.

So, after using quick searches for a while, I switched to yubnub, which does something similar, but it's a social app. With ... <a class="cont" href="/oldsite/notes/php_quicklinks/">_ more</a></p>
