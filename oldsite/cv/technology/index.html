		<div class="itemsummary"><p>Eventbrite, San Francisco, CA<br /><em>Senior Systems Engineer</em><br /><ul>
				<li>One of 6 operations staff responsible for engineering infrastructure development, support and maintenance.</li>
				<li>Managed EC2 based production/qa/stage environments using Puppet, Console, and Terraform.</li>
				<li>Participated in on-call rotations, typically used Icinga alert info, Splunk logs (and syslog logs), Grafana graphs & Sentry captures to diagnose issues.</li>
				<li>Mainly supported Linux/Mysql/HAProxy/Nginx/Python/Django based applications. Also provided support for numerous technologies including: Cassandra, Redis, Elasticsearch, Varnish, & others.</li>
				<li>Participated in a number of open source projects with issue creation or patch submission as we integrated them into our environments, see https://github.com/ethan-eb</li>
				<li>Aggressive documentation contributor, spearheaded runbook documentation with links to specific icinga alerts.</li>
				<li>Developed a wide range of tooling, primarily in Python or shell. 
					<ul>
				<li>At the simpler end were tools that checked metrics for Icinga alerts, or for submission to StatsD/Graphite, or for interacting with APIs (for example DYN, NS1, Fastly APIs). </li>
				<li>At the more complex end I developed an admin SPA for engineers to create feature flag "proposals." The tool used Mysql, Django, Backbone/Marionette and integrated with our Gargoyle based feature flags. It allowed operations staff to simply approve or deny a proposal without giving direct access to production feature flags.</li>
				<li>Also implemented an Errbot instance for Slack including a docker profile for developers to work on their plugins independently. Developed plugins for interactions with JIRA and for reporting on feature flag changes.</li></ul></li>
