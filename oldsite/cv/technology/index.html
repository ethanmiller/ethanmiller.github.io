		<div class="itemsummary"><p>Eventbrite, San Francisco, CA<br /><em>Senior Systems Engineer</em><br /><ul><li>Typical responsibilities for System Engineers include: Developing (Puppet) configuration manifests, developing and watching monitoring (Nagios, Ganglia), running deployments across CDE environment (fabric based), as well as more specialized per-project work.</li><li>Supported and operationalized "Mandoline" project: This was a data analysis project based on Cassandra, MySQL and Zookeeper with a python front-end. I developed configuration for the clusters involved, including cron and supervisord based scripts to run the analysis. Considerable Cassandra work was involved, including numerous new Ganglia graphs to asses performance of the application.</li><li>Led late 2013 database failover: This was required to get our primary MySQL master over to a machine with more disk space. I analyzed dependencies across our systems and developed a run-script for the procedure from start to finish. I performed the systems administration components (stop/start daemons, configure haproxy for static maintenance page, DNS adjustment) of the failover while the DBA worked on the database.</li><li>Developed custom "Noise" graph for Nagios: A page that processes Nagios logs, and then displays the daily alerts per-cluster, and per-host as a graph. We use this to see at a glance over longer periods of time which clusters have been alerting most frequently</li><li>Operationalized blog management: We increased the number of company blogs during my first year at Eventbrite. We used to run a single blog on an a single host which also ran the database. I standardized the build/deploy, configured haproxy to split traffic amongst 2 or more blog-www servers, and configured a master-master database server pair.</li></ul></p> </div>
