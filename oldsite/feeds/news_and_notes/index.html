</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/alertsite_pagerduty/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the "had an itch" desk: A simple tool to translate between to APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For users of both AlertSite and PagerDuty there's no ideal integration alternative. AlertSite will notify with an HTTP POST, and PagerDuty's API will accept POST data, but the formats are incompatible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a simple tool to translate between the AlertSite status alerts, and the PagerDuty trigger/resolve Generic API. All it needs is your Service API Key from PagerDuty. It will accept POST alerts from AlertSite and forward them along ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://alertsite2pd.appspot.com/"&gt;http://alertsite2pd.appspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's certainly not as abstract as such a tool could be - but it was quick to implement, and works fine. I have no idea how many others would find this useful, but I can't be the only one. Anyone with a google account can set up their own bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/cronline/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently hacked up a project I'm calling 'Cronline' and I'm hoping to get some feedback on further development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We run a large number of crontab scripts on different systems, under different user accounts. We see the mail that results from most jobs, and get reports when errors occur. We have a general sense of how long each script takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it's a fairly opaque system. The goal of cronline is too pull all that activity into one &lt;em&gt;timeline&lt;/em&gt; to see clearly how long jobs are taking, and which jobs end up running simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has also been a suggestion to exercise some control over cron scripts as a whole - ie maintenance-mode that would prevent all scripts from running - this is certainly possible with the system as I've laid it out - but I'm not sure it should be part of the same project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a working implementation as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A simple bash script that stores the start datetime, then runs &lt;strong&gt;$*&lt;/strong&gt; (all arguments given to the script as a command), then logs the &lt;em&gt;[command] '&amp;lt;start datetime&amp;gt;' '&amp;lt;end datetime&amp;gt;'&lt;/em&gt;. Currently logs by username (eg. /var/local/cronline/bob.log)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A modification to any given crontab in which a job &lt;em&gt;mycmd arg1 arg2&lt;/em&gt; is replaced with &lt;em&gt;/usr/local/bin/cronline mycmd arg1 arg2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A simple python script that runs through the cronline logs, and spits out a JSON file suitable for use with &lt;a href="http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/"&gt;Simile Timeline&lt;/a&gt;. The script currently just takes 2 arguments: The log file, and a color to distinguish different user crontab jobs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A simple directory structure with the Simile Timeline project, and a directory for the JSON output of the python script. It's served up by Apache (see screenshot below).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Desired Features and Fixes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should probably fix:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why the intermediary python processing? It could just produce the JSON directly... That's true, but that would make it harder to implement on a distrubted system (see the next bullet)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use standard system logging: As above, if the bash script used system logging, it could be used in combination with &lt;a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/"&gt;rsyslog&lt;/a&gt; to aggregate logs onto one system, which would then run the python script to produce the finished JSON.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capture exit code for each job, and color-code that into the final timeline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capture additional stats (&lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; for example can capture CPU% and Avg Memory use)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timespans under 10 min should just be a singular event (no end date so that it renders as a dot)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Logrotate-type action on the JSON output - and possibly some way to go back to an archive. The accumulated JSON data will get too large pretty quick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improve Simile Timeline integration: Currently I'm manually editing the javascript to load each new js file I know to be available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would this be useful to you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions on how to structure this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any other suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</description><guid>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/cronline/</guid></item><item><title>Test Server Puzzle
</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/test_server_puzzle/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I recently had the opportunity to rebuild our test server system for QA testing at work, and I found a few solutions that I thought worth sharing. The finished system centers around a custom console for reserving test servers, launching repository checkouts and/or database reloads, and viewing a short history of configurations for that server. See the screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Need&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last 6 months plus we had been running no more than 4 test servers on an old machine without hardware virtualization support. Any attempt to run a 5th virtual server would likely wedge the machine. This was by no means sufficient for QA needs. The first step was getting a new host machine (we went with a Dell PowerEdge R610). Next was choosing the toolset. I started with &lt;a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page"&gt;KVM&lt;/a&gt;, got a base CentOS image running with the &lt;a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/kvm-virt-install-install-freebsd-centos-guest/"&gt;virt-install command&lt;/a&gt;, and moved on to puppet mastering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Puppet configuration management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt; has been a huge win for us in general over the last several months. In particular, with the 4 test servers on the old system I was already hopelessly out of sync with the configurations (they should have been identical systems). I already had most of the package configuration written for other application environments - it took just a little tweaking and node regular expressions to get 90% of the configuration set for all of the new servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our stack is basically Linux, Apache/mod_wsgi, Django, virtualenvs and Postgres. Puppet now manages just about all of that and quite a bit more. The only pieces I didn't feel I could manage through Puppet were repository checkouts, and the settings files that are server and application specific: apache.conf, wsgi and the django settings file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Database&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have large databases. We are working on scripts to trim those down to smaller QA sets, but for the time being we test on full copies. On the old test servers, getting a fresh database meant an scp for the dmp file, and then a pg_restore. For our largest DB this process was known to take nearly two hours. With the new setup I opted for a separate, non-virtualized db host. I had already seen that copydb with the --template flag was much faster than a pg_restore. In addition I reasoned that since the virtual test servers wouldn't have an abundance of RAM (1GB each) it would be more efficient to let a dedicated machine handle the databases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now have one nightly job that transfers the dmp file from our backups, and runs pg_restore. For the rest of the day copies of those databases are made on the database server as needed. The "base" databases can't be used normally - that's the one caveat to the "copydb" plan. They just sit there to support copying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Console&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My design process was completely centered on "the console," and what would be ideal to have there in support of developer and QA needs. It runs on the virtual server host - and I made an effort to make it as lean as I could. It consists of a &lt;a href="http://webpy.org/"&gt;web.py&lt;/a&gt; script (served by apache/cgi) with Python pickles for storage, and a front end built with &lt;a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/"&gt;Backbone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://mustache.github.com/"&gt;Mustache&lt;/a&gt;. The web.py script has very limited access to virsh commands on the backend (currently just 'list' to get the names and status of each virtual machine), and basically only serves JSON (plus the initial HTML page that links to javascript and CSS files).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two "external" jobs that support our test servers. One is the nightly job that runs scp and pg_restore. The second job is touched off by developers at the console. They choose the app, the repository path, and either a DB load, a code checkout, or both (see the screenshots below). The "build" job has to function within a queue to avoid the problem of two developers trying to copy the same "base" DB at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supporting scripts for the "build" job are the bash script on the DB server that runs copydb, another bash script on the virtual test server that runs the svn checkout, and a python script on the virtual test server that uses Django templates to render configuration files (apache conf, wsgi file, and django settings). I thought using Django templating made a lot of sense: Django has to be on all the servers to support our apps, and developers are already well familiar with django templates in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A step in the right direction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're all still excited about the new test servers because they're such an improvement. The job that used to take two hours now takes 20 minutes (including a full repository checkout). As of today I've got 15 of them running, and I have room to grow. Once we exceed the capacity of the one host server, I'm not sure how I'll adapt the system. That may be the moment to jump onto the &lt;a href="http://www.openstack.org/"&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt; wagon (which is where I nearly started).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the whole it was a lot of fun, and I learned a lot. I'd be interested to hear how others addressed these problems as well, or suggestions on how to improve what I've got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</description><guid>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/test_server_puzzle/</guid></item><item><title>Virtual State of Jefferson Tech
</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/virtual_state_jefferson_tech/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;My collaboration with &lt;a href="http://www.ethanham.com/"&gt;Ethan Ham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/projects/virtual_state_jefferson/"&gt;Virtual State of Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; will be going up in Ashland at the &lt;a href="http://www.sou.edu/sma/"&gt;Schneider Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt; next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to describe a little about the tech work involved because I had fun, and it might be useful to others. The piece is a router running &lt;a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index"&gt;dd-wrt&lt;/a&gt; with an iptables rule that sends all traffic through a proxy. The proxy server is running &lt;a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="http://nginx.org/"&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt;. Squid is configured with a redirect_program that does the following for each request:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skip resources that are likely not text based (images, videos, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For text-based resources, grab the source and do a quick regex search for 'california', 'ca' or 'oregon'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For resources that have one of the previous, do a full regex search/replace for cities in northern California, or southern Oregon that appear next to their state name/abbreviation (resulting in "Ashland, Jefferson" instead of "Ashland, Oregon", for example)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save the modified file on the nginx path, and transparently redirect the request to that file&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole setup was heavily influenced by the &lt;a href="http://www.ex-parrot.com/pete/upside-down-ternet.html"&gt;upside-down-ternet&lt;/a&gt;, but since I prefer to work in Python, I used &lt;a href="http://gofedora.com/how-to-write-custom-redirector-rewritor-plugin-squid-python/"&gt;this script&lt;/a&gt; as my starting point. The toughest part was probably figuring out the right iptable rule to stick on the router, here is the script I ended up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="code"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code class="bash"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PROXY_IP=[proxy-ip]&lt;br /&gt;PROXY_PORT=3128&lt;br /&gt;LAN_IP=`nvram get lan_ipaddr`&lt;br /&gt;LAN_NET=$LAN_IP/`nvram get lan_netmask`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if [ "$1" = "delete" ]; then&lt;br /&gt;        ACTION=D&lt;br /&gt;else&lt;br /&gt;        ACTION=A&lt;br /&gt;fi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cmd="iptables -t nat -$ACTION PREROUTING -s $LAN_NET -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination $PROXY_IP:$PROXY_PORT"&lt;br /&gt;echo $cmd&lt;br /&gt;$cmd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;                         &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's fun using sys-admin skills for an art project :D&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/jquery_simplemultiselect/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;v 1.1.2 Jun 06 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This plugin replaces a standard multi-select with a simplified version that doesn't require ctrl+click to select multiple options. Each click simply toggles the given option on or off. The original multi-select is hidden, and a replacement is built. The original multi-select is updated on each click so that when when your form is submitted, you get what you expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This plugin was inspired this &lt;a href="http://tech.forumone.com/archives/135-JQuery-Multi-select-Box-Alternative.html"&gt;blog post by Matt Gibbs&lt;/a&gt; - I just packaged it up into a plugin you can drop on your form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Initial development of this open source project was supported by &lt;a href="http://energy-solution.com/"&gt;Energy Solutions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;li&gt;jQuery 1.3+&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;.. and that's it. No other plugins, or CSS changes. If you would like full control over the CSS, that's possible as well, see below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="code"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;code class="javascript"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$('select').simpleMultiSelect();&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All/none functions are also included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="code"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;code class="javascript"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$('select').smsNone();&lt;br /&gt;$('select').smsAll();&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;Options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Default options shown below, override as needed ... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;pre class="code"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;code class="javascript"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$('select').simpleMultiSelect({&lt;br /&gt;    highlight : '#CCE',&lt;br /&gt;    border : '#777',&lt;br /&gt;    width : undefined,&lt;br /&gt;    height : undefined,&lt;br /&gt;    classesOnly : false,&lt;br /&gt;    container : 'sms-container',&lt;br /&gt;    pseudoSelect : 'sms-pseudo-select',&lt;br /&gt;    selected : 'sms-selected',&lt;br /&gt;    unselected : 'sms-unselected',&lt;br /&gt;    disabled : 'sms-disabled',&lt;br /&gt;    optgroup : 'sms-optgroup',&lt;br /&gt;    optgroupLabel : 'sms-optgroup-label'&lt;br /&gt;});&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;Example 1 : default functionality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	&lt;p&gt;The width, height, and font attributes will be copied over from the existing &amp;lt;select&amp;gt; element (thanks &lt;a href="http://github.com/akaihola"&gt;Antti Kaihola&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;select id="sel0" multiple="multiple"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="0"&gt;option one&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="1" selected disabled&gt;option dos (disabled and selected)&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="2"&gt;option the third&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="3"&gt;option four which preceeds the fifth&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option selected value="4"&gt;option five&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="5"&gt;option seis&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&lt;optgroup label="Optgroup example"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option selected value="6"&gt;option chi&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="7"&gt;option ba&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="8"&gt;option chiu&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="9"&gt;option shi&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="10"&gt;option shi yi&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&lt;/optgroup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="11"&gt;option second to last&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="12"&gt;option the last&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/select&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;input type="button" id="nada0" value="none"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;input type="button" id="todos0" value="all"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;Example 2 : classesOnly override&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;By default, simpleMultiSelect uses inline styles. If you'd like full control over the styles, you can use the classesOnly option. The plugin will then only add class names, and toggle them for selected items. You'll need to provide your own CSS styles, for example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;pre class="code"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;code class="css"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;div.custom-select-box{&lt;br /&gt;    background-color:#CCC;&lt;br /&gt;    padding:5px;&lt;br /&gt;    width:400px;&lt;br /&gt;    cursor:default;&lt;br /&gt;    font-family: "arial", sans-serif;&lt;br /&gt;    font-size:0.8em;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;div.custom-select-box div.custom-unselect{&lt;br /&gt;    background-color:#EEE;&lt;br /&gt;    padding:3px;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;div.custom-select-box div.custom-select{&lt;br /&gt;    background-color:#FFF;&lt;br /&gt;    padding:3px;&lt;br /&gt;    font-weight:bold;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;div.custom-select-box div.custom-disabled{&lt;br /&gt;    color:#844;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;div.custom-select-box div.custom-optgroup{&lt;br /&gt;    padding:5px;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;div.custom-select-box div.custom-optgroup-label{&lt;br /&gt;    background-color:#EE9;&lt;br /&gt;    padding:5px;&lt;br /&gt;    font-weight:bold;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And then override a few simpleMultiSelect options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;pre class="code"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;code class="javascript"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$('select').simpleMultiSelect({&lt;br /&gt;    classesOnly : true, &lt;br /&gt;    pseudoSelect : 'custom-select-box', &lt;br /&gt;    selected : 'custom-select',&lt;br /&gt;    unselected : 'custom-unselect',&lt;br /&gt;    disabled : 'custom-disabled',&lt;br /&gt;    optgroup : 'custom-optgroup',&lt;br /&gt;    optgroupLabel : 'custom-optgroup-label'&lt;br /&gt;});&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;select id="sel1" multiple="multiple"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="0"&gt;option one&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="1" disabled&gt;option dos (disabled)&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="2"&gt;option the third&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="3"&gt;option four which preceeds the fifth&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option selected value="4"&gt;option five&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="5"&gt;option seis&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&lt;optgroup label="Optgroup example"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option selected value="6"&gt;option chi&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="7"&gt;option ba&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="8"&gt;option chiu&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="9"&gt;option shi&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="10"&gt;option shi yi&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&lt;/optgroup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="11"&gt;option second to last&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;option value="12"&gt;option the last&lt;/option&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/select&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;input type="button" id="nada1" value="none"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;input type="button" id="todos1" value="all"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/appengine_handle_entity/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just spent a frustrating evening with Google AppEngine - and I want to document the problem I had in case it helps others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to upload data to AppEngine from a CSV file - however the values in said file needed some adjustments (they don't directly correspond to the fields in the table I have, and some are ReferenceProperty fields). The &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/uploadingdata.html"&gt;AppEngine documentation on uploading data&lt;/a&gt; says nothing about overriding handle_entity to deal with these requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://www.wooji-juice.com/blog/appengine-bulkloader.html"&gt;a couple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://amandastea.wordpress.com/2009/05/26/google-app-engine-uploadding-data-tutorial/"&gt;of pages&lt;/a&gt; that appeared to be what I needed. They document how to override HandleEntity() in your loader class. I spent ages futzing with this. It wasn't until I looked in the SDK source code that I realized the function to override is called handle_entity()! There is an alias_old_names() in there you can call - but who knew?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the record, I'm using &lt;strong&gt;Release 1.2.2&lt;/strong&gt; of the AppEngine SDK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is what my loader class looks like now:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="code"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;import datetime, os, sys&lt;br /&gt;# 'sources' and 'models' down there are not on the python path&lt;br /&gt;curr_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))&lt;br /&gt;sys.path = ['/'.join(curr_path.split('/')[:-1])] + sys.path&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from google.appengine.ext import db&lt;br /&gt;from google.appengine.tools import bulkloader&lt;br /&gt;from sources import cct&lt;br /&gt;from models import Label, cctRegion, cctVariable, Record&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;class RecordLoader(bulkloader.Loader):&lt;br /&gt;    def __init__(self):&lt;br /&gt;        bulkloader.Loader.__init__(self, 'Record', &lt;br /&gt;                                   [('variable', str), &lt;br /&gt;                                    ('var_type', str),&lt;br /&gt;                                    ('region', str), &lt;br /&gt;                                    ('year', int),&lt;br /&gt;                                    ('month', int),&lt;br /&gt;                                    ('quantity', float)])&lt;br /&gt;    def handle_entity(self, entity):&lt;br /&gt;        kname = ''.join([entity.region, entity.variable, &lt;br /&gt;                         str(entity.year), str(entity.month)])&lt;br /&gt;        if Record.get_by_key_name(kname):&lt;br /&gt;            return&lt;br /&gt;        cct.support_classes() # needed classes exist in db&lt;br /&gt;        q = entity.quantity&lt;br /&gt;        dt = datetime.datetime(entity.year, entity.month, 1)&lt;br /&gt;        label = Label.all().filter('name = ', 'cct').get()&lt;br /&gt;        variable = cctVariable.all().filter('short_name = ', entity.variable).get()&lt;br /&gt;        region = cctRegion.all().filter('short_name = ', entity.region).get()&lt;br /&gt;        # reset the entity here to avoid &lt;br /&gt;        # unneeded attributes, and set keyname&lt;br /&gt;        entity = Record(key_name=kname)&lt;br /&gt;        entity.label = label.key()&lt;br /&gt;        entity.variable = variable.key()&lt;br /&gt;        entity.region = region.key()&lt;br /&gt;        entity.time = dt&lt;br /&gt;        entity.quantity = q&lt;br /&gt;        return entity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;loaders = [RecordLoader]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/ubiquity_click/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/ubiquity/"&gt;Ubiquity&lt;/a&gt; seems like a great project. However, in my case, I've tried it twice and just haven't managed to fold it into my workflow. I'm not entirely sure why that is - but part of it has to do with my aversion to using the mouse more than necessary. I've also been using &lt;a href="http://vimperator.org/trac/wiki/Vimperator"&gt;vimperator&lt;/a&gt; which lets me fly through pages without the hunting and pecking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, during my second Ubiquity effort, I wanted to make it a bit more vimperator-like. I wanted a command to help me find and activate links on a page without the mouse. I put &lt;a href="http://code.ethanmiller.name/click.js"&gt;click.js&lt;/a&gt; together quickly, and am offering it here as a prototype. I'll be switching back to vimperator again, and have a few big projects coming up, so I don't expect to work on click.js again in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click.js searches the links on the page, and displays those that match the text you've entered. Press return to follow the link. If you find it useful, or develop the script further - please let me know in the comments below!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/stream_or_reservoir/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a question that keep coming up lately: In the context of data flows, what should I treat like a stream, and what should I treat like a reservoir?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain what I mean by example: my email inbox is a reservoir. Although data streams in, it's clearly something that's supposed to be fully processed. It doesn't seem correct to let email float by without reading, then deleting or archiving (although it certainly happens).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;First confusing case: &lt;a href="http://delicious.com"&gt;Delicious&lt;/a&gt; - I started &lt;a href="http://delicious.com/Ethan/"&gt;my Delicious account&lt;/a&gt; in Sept of 2004. I have basically been using it as a reservoir until recently. When I started using it I adapted my mental model for 'bookmarks' in my browser. I basically worked under the assumption that I was creating a finite list of resources that I would prune when necessary, and return to as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, what has become clear is that I almost never prune my collection, and I only occasionally use it to look up a link that I wanted to remember. It's really a stream. Like &lt;a href="http://digg.com/"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt; it's just a way to comment on a link, take note of it, share it, and let it go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next confusing case: &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/reader"&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; (really it's any feed reader, but Google Reader has some features that highlight my confusion). I have been using it as a reservoir - I &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ethanmiller/status/1281096257"&gt;recently realized&lt;/a&gt; the reservoir model is actually stronger for my feed reader than it is for my inbox, for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think Google Reader provides some confusing signals in this area. It very prominently shows you the number of unread items - it does this in several places. That's clearly part of the reservoir model - for me at least, it creates a need to see a nice fat ZERO. At the same time, Google Reader makes &lt;a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-like-big-charts-and-i-cannot-lie.html"&gt;trends&lt;/a&gt; available to you - which compare the number of items posted to the number of items you've read. This implies that it's expected that some items just float by unread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I'm always loosing the battle to keep up with stuff I'm interested in, the issue comes up a lot. I'm trying to treat my feed reader like a stream. If I succeed, Google Reader will permanently show "1000+" for unread items - bothersome, but I prefer this to un-subscribing from great feeds, and completely missing those posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are certain feeds I need to capture 100% of the time (for example, updates on software tools I use, or friend's feeds). I know I can solve this with folders - but it doesn't really resolve my question about how I really want to treat these data flows.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/lost_images/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5157818/diskdigger-recovers-deleted-files"&gt;lifehacker post about a DiskDigger&lt;/a&gt; reminded me that I wanted to document a recent close call with a bunch of photos we took on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was running Ubuntu with &lt;a href="http://www.xfce.org/"&gt;xfce&lt;/a&gt;, and when the SD card on our camera filled up, I wanted to transfer the photos off.  Well it turns out that &lt;a href="http://thunar.xfce.org/index.html"&gt;thunar&lt;/a&gt; (at least my version) doesn't show a progress bar when copying files. I foolishly erased the SD card before the transfer had finished and, uh, I did it with &lt;strong&gt;$ rm *.JPG&lt;/strong&gt; :(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tip on how to &lt;a href="http://adminlinux.blogspot.com/2006/09/recover-from-rm.html"&gt;Recover from rm&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking on the right track (I guess). I ran &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre class="code"&gt;&lt;code class="bash"&gt;$ cat /dev/mmcblk0/ &gt; recover.db&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; resulting in a 2GB file (it was a 2GB SD card) that I spent the next day and a half tinkering with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had some of the images from that card on hand, and using the &lt;a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1326"&gt;octal dump&lt;/a&gt; command: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre class="code"&gt;&lt;code class="bash"&gt;$ od -x IMG_4415.JPG | head&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could tell that the beginning of each image looked like this (in hexadecimal): d8ff e1ff fe35 7845 6669 0000 4949 002a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I messed around with &lt;a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/cmd.csp?path=c/csplit"&gt;csplit&lt;/a&gt; for a while, but I had no idea how to split on non-ascii patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found a perl script written by someone who had a similar problem. I can't seem to find that page again, although I know I hit this &lt;a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/24895/Accidentally-Concatenated-Images"&gt;metafilter thread&lt;/a&gt; along the way. The script I ended up with was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre class="code"&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# d8ff e1ff fe35 7845 6669 0000 4949 002a&lt;br /&gt;$sep = "\xff\xd8\xff\xe1";&lt;br /&gt;print "opening\n";&lt;br /&gt;open(F, "recover.db");&lt;br /&gt;@original = &amp;lt;F&amp;gt;;&lt;br /&gt;close(F);&lt;br /&gt;print "opened\n";&lt;br /&gt;$x = join "", @original;&lt;br /&gt;print "splitting\n";&lt;br /&gt;@new = split $sep, $x;&lt;br /&gt;print "splitted\n";&lt;br /&gt;$count = 1;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;foreach(@new){&lt;br /&gt;        print "$count\n";&lt;br /&gt;        open(F, "&gt; recovered$count.jpg");&lt;br /&gt;        print F $sep;&lt;br /&gt;        print F $_;&lt;br /&gt;        close(F);&lt;br /&gt;        $count++;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got all the photos back! My route may have been circuitous, but it was an interesting ride. If you know of a more direct route please let me know...&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/tantalum_memorial/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During ZERO1 last summer I (along with several other grad students) collaborated with &lt;a href="http://montalvoarts.org/artist_groups/harwood_wright_yokokoji/"&gt;Harwood, Wright, Yokokoji&lt;/a&gt; to create the &lt;a href="http://01sj.org/?p=274"&gt;Superlight&lt;/a&gt; version of &lt;a href="http://mediashed.org/TantalumMemorial"&gt;Tantalum Memorial&lt;/a&gt;. I heard a few days ago that Tantalum Memorial won first prize at Transmediale! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.transmediale.de/en/node/3214/"&gt;Transmediale 2009 winners page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://artshiftsanjose.com/?p=938"&gt;writeup Thomas Asmuth did for ArtShift&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metroactive.com/metro/02.18.09/alleys-0907.html"&gt;writeup by Gary Singh for the Metro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My part in the project was writing the perl script that pulled phone numbers from a database, and sent them to the strowger switches via a modem. The &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pookieevans/2516058576/"&gt;script also printed it's activities to a terminal screen&lt;/a&gt;. In addition I worked on automating the installation computer for startup/shutdown and pulling fresh data from another database in London. A big thanks to Peter Spangler, when things got crazy in the run up to 01SJ, Peter pitched in and wrote the &lt;a href="http://expect.nist.gov/"&gt;Expect&lt;/a&gt; script that actually managed the database update, I just had to run his script from crontab.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><guid>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/tantalum_memorial/</guid></item><item><title>Technology Shapes Space
</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/technology_shapes_space/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We got a &lt;a href="http://www.neurostechnology.com/neuros-link"&gt;Neuros Link&lt;/a&gt; last week. It's basically an Ubuntu box with HDMI out and a handy wireless keyboard. I want to say a few things about how it has changed the space in front of the TV, and then I have some comments about the Neuros Link itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;TV Space&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most obvious change is that watching TV is not as passive as it used to be. Instead of the TV constantly yelling at us, it waits for us to initiate the interaction based on our interests. It feels natural because we've been doing that on desktop computers for a while now. That's essentially what I wanted out of the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I didn't expect was the way it highlights the fact that technology shapes interactions in it's vicinity. The distance between me, Sheau (my wife), and the screen are all different now. The positions of our bodies and the gestures we make are different as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching TV on the desktop before was always a somewhat awkward experience - we had to position chairs, or accept an odd viewing angle. It felt as if it was imposing something on the space. It intruded upon the one-person-one-computer hunched-over-keyboard nose-3ft-from-screen position we know and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we sit back on the couch more comfortably. There's less conflict between interacting with the computer (searching for something online) and interacting with those around us. Only the keyboard is left floating around the coffee table - a strangely detached left-over from the desktop interaction model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm enjoying it, and will be interested to see how the experience changes over time, or affects my sense of HCI overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Neuros Link&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew the Link was basically an Ubuntu box when I bought it. The only other option i was excited about was building my own Ubuntu box for the same purpose. The Neuros Link just meant I didn't have to figure out which components to buy. To that extent, I'm very happy with the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't clear on what Neuros.TV was, however. It turned out to be a web app. An online video aggregator that runs in a fullscreen Firefox window when you start the Link up. I tried looking up a couple of videos, but once I realized that I was just getting &lt;a href="http://www.hulu.com/"&gt;hulu.com&lt;/a&gt; in a frame, for example - I just went straight to hulu.com instead. I also have a &lt;a href="http://delicious.com/Ethan/tv"&gt;list of TV related links&lt;/a&gt; that I can go to if I get tired of hulu - a few of them are also aggregators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't quite see the value of investing energy in Neuros.TV. I think that as online TV becomes more and more popular there are going to be more and more services doing the same thing - and many will probably be better than Neuros.TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the efforts would be better placed in refining the platform. For example, even after increasing default font sizes to 14pt, Gnome (as is) doesn't seem like a particularly good desktop manager for this. The &lt;a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/151"&gt;netbook remix launcher&lt;/a&gt;, for example, seems like it could reduce the eye strain I've been running into (I may try that...).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refinements could also go into Firefox. I was getting pretty tired of ctrl++ until I found the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2592"&gt;No Squint&lt;/a&gt; extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe these issues have more to do with my mere 32" screen, but these are my impressions at the moment. It's hard for me to judge how this will work for the average user (I was already familiar with Ubuntu) - but I don't think a fullscreen firefox window and a webapp will do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</description><guid>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/technology_shapes_space/</guid></item><item><title>ELO 08: Day 3
</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/elo08_day3/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reading Digital Media&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laura Borràs Castanyer and Joan Elies Adell both from &lt;a href="http://www.uoc.edu/in3/hermeneia/cat/som/membres.html"&gt;Hermeneia&lt;/a&gt; discussed how the operation of reading works in the light of new and changing technologies. As in other presentations they brought up the contrast between 'surface' reading, or 'sufing' the text instead of immersion in a text. Castanyer connected this pattern to reading the poetry of John Ashbery as an example (&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2114565/"&gt;this Slate article&lt;/a&gt; discusses 'skimming' Ashbery poetry). They also had interesting observations about the modernist aspect of new technologies. They described our culture as experiencing a cyclical interference from the next 'new' thing - disruptions that suit the modernist pattern of breaking with convention and finding new means of expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://home.sw.rr.com/crenshawwebsite/"&gt;Cheri Crenshaw&lt;/a&gt;'s presentation concerned a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogic"&gt;dialogic&lt;/a&gt; approach to electronic literature in which a classic work is 'remediated' in an electronic medium. An example is Shelly Jackson's &lt;a href="http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/PatchworkGirl.html"&gt;Patchwork Girl&lt;/a&gt; as it relates to Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. Crenshaw argues that this kind of 'transgression' (Crenshaw referenced Donna Haraway here) creates a potent fusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~dhowe/"&gt;Daniel Howe&lt;/a&gt; presented his work on &lt;a href="http://rednoise.org/rita/"&gt;RiTa&lt;/a&gt; - natural language processing software for generative literature. Howe argues that computational technology has fostered generative art in  visual/cinematic/musical domains much more than in the literary domain. RiTa is an attempt to address this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Media Art Labs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;These three presentations were on labs from different universities... &lt;a href="http://www.memmott.org/talan/index.html"&gt;Talan Memmott&lt;/a&gt; presented the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4AeyRvrzsc"&gt;Karlskrona Remixological Postcinematic Performance Machine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.yorku.ca/finearts/faculty/profs/fisherCaitlin.htm"&gt;Caitlin Fisher&lt;/a&gt; described some of the work they're doing in their augmented reality lab (for example &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKw_Mp5YkaE"&gt;using fiducial markers similar to this&lt;/a&gt;). Carolyn Guertin presented the &lt;a href="http://www.uta.edu/ra/real/editprofile.php?onlyview=1&amp;pid=1869"&gt;eCreate Lab&lt;/a&gt; at UTA, and &lt;a href="http://www.nouspace.net/dene/"&gt;Dene Grigar&lt;/a&gt; presented the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXV3XVnn3Oc"&gt;MOVE Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vision Scapes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last set of projects/research started with &lt;a href="http://www.roderickcoover.com/"&gt;Roderick Coover&lt;/a&gt;'s work on &lt;a href="http://www.unknownterritories.org/DigitalPanoramas/index.html"&gt;Digital Panoramas&lt;/a&gt; (his paper is posted there). He drew very interesting connections between 19th century rotunda panoramic murals (spacial continuity) and the the cinematic long take (temporal continuity). He is investigating the possibilities that a digital panorama offer as a fusion of those two traditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.martha.com.br/"&gt;Martha Gabriel&lt;/a&gt; presented her &lt;a href="http://digitaloracles.com.br"&gt;Digital Oracles&lt;/a&gt; project. She asks very interesting questions about our culture's relationship to search engines. She takes a critical stance, pointing out that only 2% of the web is searchable, and yet most people consider search fairly comprehensive. Search, she asserts, affect us more than televised propaganda. She also highly recommends watching &lt;a href="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/epic"&gt;Epic 2015&lt;/a&gt; (I'll watch tonight).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/elo08_day2/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, it's been about 3 weeks since the conference, but I'm just now getting the time to review my notes and post...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Transliteracy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.suethomas.net"&gt;Sue Thomas&lt;/a&gt; started with a discussion on transliteracy.  Defined simply as "the ability to read, write, and interact across a range of platforms, tools and media," transliteracy insists on a lateral approach according to Thomas : "global, historical, holistic." As several others discussed later as well, Thomas made the point that reading/writing in the traditional sense isn't a privileged means of communication anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the topic of the convergence of media/communications technology she quoted &lt;a href="http://www.henryjenkins.org/"&gt;Henry Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; as saying there are at least 5 processes that are a part of convergence: technological, economic, social/organic, cultural, and global. The article &lt;a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Biztech/12434/"&gt;Convergence? I Diverge&lt;/a&gt; by Jenkins explains more...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting thread that was picked up in other discussions was a reference to Katherine Hayles' &lt;a href="http://www.mlajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1632/prof.2007.2007.1.187?journalCode=prof"&gt;Hyper and Deep Attention&lt;/a&gt; and the point that hyper-attention probably developed first, where as the deep-attention our culture/educational system emphasizes for literacy now is a kind of luxury that developed later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In discussion from the audience the question was raised: why use the term 'literacy'? It's connected to the book tradition that we're de-emphasizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Log in&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.as.wvu.edu/~sbaldwin/"&gt;Sandy Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;'s presentation felt more like spoken word poetry then an academic paper - it was great, but flew by a little quickly. He talked about the paths that a packet takes across the network to it's destination, what a tool like traceroute tells us about that 'landscape' and how logging on is 'inscribing' yourself into that landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alansondheim.org/"&gt;Alan Sondheim&lt;/a&gt; presented remotely. He first showed a video, something similar to the video at the end of &lt;a href="http://nikuko.blogspot.com/2008/03/apologies-for-not-responding-here-ive.html"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;. I like that glitch-art aesthetic. He talked about the 'mess' or 'debris' that fills cyberspace (and is the 'essential character of culture'). Logging on and off used to be a simple binary - but now we're always partially logged on, logged out but recognized (say by a cookie in your browser), using multiple logins for a given service, or victims of a confused identity. It's neither a, nor b, but something in between, or something that overlaps. He describes that liminal place as the place where the ego is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.english.ucsb.edu/people-detail.asp?PersonID=138"&gt;Rita Raley&lt;/a&gt;'s talk I find difficult to summarize - but I felt that her perspective was closest to my own. She talked about using data, either gathered like Hansen/Rubin's Listening Post or solicited. Seemed to me to be related to social networks, and data visualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ReVisioning Electronic Literature&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~mcmarino/"&gt;Mark Marino&lt;/a&gt; talked about the history of chatbots, AI, and the Turing test. He used an interesting model in his talk based around &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_network_theory"&gt;actor network theory&lt;/a&gt; - humans and machines are both conversational actors within a common network. He also brought in an interesting historical perspective on this kind of network : &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_friend_or_foe"&gt;military IFF systems&lt;/a&gt;. I liked this presentation because it de-emphasized the concern over traditional AI (can we build a real thinking machine?) and presented a bigger context - the network as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jeremydouglass.com/"&gt;Jeremy Douglass&lt;/a&gt; is a researcher at &lt;a href="http://lab.softwarestudies.com/"&gt;Software Studies&lt;/a&gt;, a program I've been tracking with much interest. He talked about the mental 'geography' that a user might develop during an interactive process with a given software system. For a non-programmer in particular, there's that negotiation where they develop a model of how the system works, test out their model, and adjust as needed. Douglass calls this model 'implied code.' As he discussed, interesting games/systems allow enough room for the user to explore, and experience that moment (as a surprise) when their implied code and the machine code sync, and new possibilities are discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Elit as IS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final group of presentations was somewhat more technical/pragmatic. &lt;a href="http://www.math.fsu.edu/~jgutierr/jbg_personal/index_en.html"&gt;Juan Gutierrez&lt;/a&gt; led an interesting discussion about applying the multitier model from software (presentation/logic/data) to electronic literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/elo08_workshops/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Amerika presented the opening workshop "Remix Writing and Postproduction Art" this morning. He began with this &lt;a href="http://www1.hollins.edu/classes/dance/website/newmediaweb/mereweb/merecom.html"&gt;Vito Acconci quote&lt;/a&gt; about interdisciplinary practices. Later in the morning this led into an interesting question about using the term 'literature' for practices that are mostly audio/visual. No one seemed inclined to enforce a conservative notion of 'literature.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Amerika did say at one point that he was working on an assumption that writing (I understand this to mean narrative/fiction or poetry writing) was a core practice for this audience. There was also a lot of discussion around teaching remix writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting question that came up is if remix as a practice has to be satirical, or a kind of activist critique. Another conference participant made the point that at the moment copyright questions loom large, and force the remixer into a counter-culture position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few links for topics/publications/individuals discussed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kM5Zc8BUw2QC"&gt;Paul Miller, Rhythm Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thebooksmusic.com/"&gt;The Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114500/"&gt;Sonic Outlaws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theinventionofhugocabret.com/about_hugo_intro.htm"&gt;The Invention of Hugo Cabret&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second session I attended was "Live Audio and Visuals" with Stefan Müller Arisona who works on a project called &lt;a href="http://www.corebounce.org/wiki/Soundium/Front"&gt;Soundium&lt;/a&gt; for live video mixing, and &lt;a href="http://www.telebody.ws/"&gt;Steve Gibson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve took us through Ableton Live, software for mixing loop based audio.And Stefan took us through a more general presentation about performing audio and video. A lot of good information about hardware/software and practical considerations to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/pyglet_pycairo/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been excited about using &lt;a href="http://www.pyglet.org/"&gt;Pyglet&lt;/a&gt; for  all it's nice timing/windowing/event handling. And then I got excited about the nice graphics programming from &lt;a href="http://www.tortall.net/mu/wiki/CairoTutorial"&gt;PyCairo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't find any examples of the two combined, so, with the help of &lt;a href="http://www.pygame.org/wiki/CairoPygame"&gt;this PyGame example&lt;/a&gt; I munged the following together. Just posting in case it helps someone else... we'll see where all this takes me...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="code"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;import cairo, cStringIO&lt;br /&gt;from pyglet import font, window, image&lt;br /&gt;w, h = 400, 400&lt;br /&gt;rot = 0.04&lt;br /&gt;# pyglet&lt;br /&gt;win = window.Window(width=w, height=h)&lt;br /&gt;ft = font.load('Arial', 36)&lt;br /&gt;text = font.Text(ft, 'Hello, World!')&lt;br /&gt;# cairo&lt;br /&gt;surface = cairo.ImageSurface(cairo.FORMAT_ARGB32, w, h)&lt;br /&gt;ctx = cairo.Context(surface)&lt;br /&gt;ctx.translate(200, 200)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while not win.has_exit:&lt;br /&gt;        # cairo&lt;br /&gt;        ctx.rotate(rot)&lt;br /&gt;        # clear to black&lt;br /&gt;        ctx.set_source_rgb(0, 0, 0)&lt;br /&gt;        ctx.paint()&lt;br /&gt;        # lifted from pycairo example...&lt;br /&gt;        ctx.set_line_width(15)&lt;br /&gt;        ctx.set_source_rgb(255, 0, 0)&lt;br /&gt;        ctx.move_to(0, -100)&lt;br /&gt;        ctx.line_to(100, 100)&lt;br /&gt;        ctx.rel_line_to(-200, 0)&lt;br /&gt;        ctx.close_path()&lt;br /&gt;        ctx.stroke()&lt;br /&gt;        # output to file-like obj&lt;br /&gt;        f = cStringIO.StringIO()&lt;br /&gt;        surface.write_to_png(f)&lt;br /&gt;        # rewind&lt;br /&gt;        f.seek(0)&lt;br /&gt;        # load&lt;br /&gt;        pic = image.load('hint.png', file=f)&lt;br /&gt;        #pyglet&lt;br /&gt;        win.dispatch_events()&lt;br /&gt;        win.clear()&lt;br /&gt;        pic.blit(0, 0)&lt;br /&gt;        text.draw()&lt;br /&gt;        win.flip()&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/old_paintings/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent my entire undergrad and several years after that pretty seriously dedicated to canvas painting. There had always been a kind of formalism I was interested in that had to do with systematic arrangements and relationships. In early work this took the form as simplified narrative images with figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm posting a few paintings here that I did shortly before joining &lt;a href="http://cadre.sjsu.edu"&gt;CADRE&lt;/a&gt; (2003-2004). At that point the formalism had turned into a logic of pattern and interlocking shapes. The interest that drove these now finds it's expression in code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</description><guid>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/old_paintings/</guid></item><item><title>Color Space
</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/color_space/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll be posting older projects here just to get them documented in my new site. This one is from May of 2005:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I became interested in exploring the area of augmented reality as well as the transformation of space through color and light. I started with a 3d visualization of the space using &lt;a href="http://processing.org"&gt;Processing&lt;/a&gt;, and the construction of three light-boxes. I connected the lights to the visualiztion with a &lt;a href="http://www.parallax.com/html_pages/products/basicstamps/basic_stamps.asp"&gt;basic stamp&lt;/a&gt; and a set of relays. Very simply, interaction with the virtual space controlled the physical space. Nine spheres are visualized in the virtual space, colored red, blue and green. Clicking on a sphere, then clicking on a box causes the light to move into the box, and turn on a light. After a short period of time, the sphere drifts out of the box, and the light turns off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peice explores a simple resonance between physical space, and code space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm pretty happy with mine, at least I didn't solder-destroy anything. It needs some tuning though, but on one side at least it definitely follows light. Thanks to Thomas for organizing and leading us through it...&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/new_site/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've reworked my site! The design is only slightly different, but I've added a &lt;a href="/oldsite/news"&gt;news section&lt;/a&gt; with an RSS feed. I'll be busy debugging and adding older content for a few days. Please let me know if you find anything that's not as it should be...&lt;/p&gt;
</description><guid>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/new_site/</guid></item><item><title>PHP Quicklink Script
</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/php_quicklinks/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so you may know about &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/geek-to-live-fifteen-firefox-quick-searches-129658.php"&gt;Firefox quick searches&lt;/a&gt;, which is very nice. But keeping them updated on multiple machines, or new machines can be a pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, after using quick searches for a while, I switched to &lt;a href="http://yubnub.org/"&gt;yubnub&lt;/a&gt;, which does something similar, but it's a social app. With yubnub, when setting up a new machine, I just had to add yubnub as a search engine once for each new machine - and I was off and running (the sequence then would be 'ctrl+k' to get to the search bar, then 'g python regex' to do a google search for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disadvantages of yubnub are: You can only add a command if someone else hasn't already added it. Also yubnub goes down fairly frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So - here is my solution: I wrote a simple PHP script that duplicates the quick search, put it on my website, then followed &lt;a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/h/3033"&gt;a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on how to create a custom search engine. That's it. I do have to log into my server and modify the array in that script when I want to create a new quicklink - but it's a minor inconvenience. I just install my custom search engine on any new machine I'm working on, and I have all my links available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://ethanmiller.name/notes/sxsw_viz/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://static.ethanmiller.name/p5/sxsw/"&gt;Java applet here&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each square represents a transcript from the SXSW conference. The brightness of the lines connecting boxes indicates the number of words shared ("noise words" are filtered out). The distance to the center of the visualization indicated the total number of connections the text shares. The closer to the center, the more words the text shares with other texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, all connections are displayed. Hovering on a box shows only the connections for that text, and the name of the text at the top of the screen. Clicking on a box selects it, so that you can hover over a second box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When hovering over a box while another box is selected, the connections for both texts will be shown, along with the titles, and the words they have in common at the top of the screen. Click on an empty area of the visualization to reset it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://switch.sjsu.edu/switch/Projects/sxswmain"&gt;More details here&lt;/a&gt;, built with &lt;a href="http://processing.org"&gt;Processing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
